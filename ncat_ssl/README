BE CAREFULL!!! The main processing idea of this script is parsing texts responces from the UE, it would be different depends on branches. Current parsing patterns in the script oriented on master branch, for example 5.2.1.0.

NCAT SSL Transparency automation test script version 2:
 Main features:
      - check for restoring sockets during PSPM suspend/resume in loop
      - TLS/DTLS support in command mode
      - based on certificate or preshared key auth supported
      - IPv4/IPv6 support
      - checking for FSM, netstat, infoall, sockets states in each loop of iteration, finest NCAT log added
      - dedicated logging for AT0, AT1, CONSOLE channels
      - logging for all openssl server sessions
      - possibility to choose uarts for use
      - data transfer over restored sockets
      - only command mode supported

 Version 2 is available:
      git repo - ssh://git-share.sequans.com:29418/integration/tools/asw/m2m/gemalto_fit_tester/ncat_ssl


The python 2.7 script ncat_ssl_v2.py provide endurance testing for NCAT software module with TLS/DTLS encription. Main case is find mulfunctions during storing/restoring NCAT SSL sockets over LPM PSPM suspending/resuming process. Current version of the script supports TLS/DTLS protocols in IPv4 or IPv6 addressing scheme. Dedicated logging for AT0, AT1, CONSOLE channels and for terminal output is available. Log files will be saved at the same directory. To run the script, user have to define IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for local PC. To run the test compaign for SSL/TLS, generating KEY (.key) and Certificate (.pem) files are required, it could be done with next commands:

openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem

Two files rootCA.key and rootCA.pem have to be placed at the same directory where script will be run. Also, before execute script input parameters have to be configured in the header of the .py file:
